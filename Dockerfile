# 
#
#  This Dockerfile is used to build a Docker image for the Crescent credentials project and sample.
#  You can build and run the sample in the container without installing any dependencies on your local machine
#  besides Docker. The browser extension can be installed from the container to your local browser and will 
#  connect to the services running in the container.
#
#  The browser extension files and sample mdl are available in /sample/docker-extension in the project
#  folder after running instantiating the container with 'docker run'.
#
#
#  Build the Docker image (this can take 30 minutes or more and use 35+ GB of disk space):
#
#    # Make sure you are in the root folder of the project even though the Dockerfile is in the sample folder
#    cd crescent-credentials
#
#    # Build the Docker image
#    docker build -t crescent-sample .
#
#
#  Run the Docker container:
#
#    A new folder called 'crescent-extension' will be created in the directory where you run the command.
#    This folder will contain the browser extension files and the sample mdl.
#
#    # Windows (Cmd)
#    docker run -v "%cd%\crescent-extension:/extension" -p 8001:8001 -p 8003:8003 -p 8004:8004 crescent-sample
#
#    # Windows (Git Bash)
#    docker run -v "$(pwd -W)\crescent-extension:/extension" -p 8001:8001 -p 8003:8003 -p 8004:8004 crescent-sample
#
#    # Linux
#    docker run -v "$(pwd)/crescent-extension:/extension" -p 8001:8001 -p 8003:8003 -p 8004:8004 crescent-sample
